# FightNight
Fighting Game Coded in Java for Grade 12 Computer Science Final Project

Instructions:

1. If you only wish to play the game, simply download the "Fight Night.jar" file and run it on two seperate computers. The game supports two modes, "online" which allows you to connect to seperate computer and "local" which allows two players to play on the same keyboard on one machine.

2. If you wish to make edits to the game or want to view the actual java code, look inside the "Greenfoot" folder. If you have Greenfoot installed, you can simply download the entire folder and click on the "project" file. Otherwise, simply view the java files using any text editor. The images/sprites used in the game are also found in this folder.

Future Updates:

0. Important: Test if java.net works on seperate networks, currently only tested on computers connected to a local network.

1. Re-comment code, currently very messy as we rushed to complete the project before the due date.
2. Add special attacks, combos and counters to improve on the complexity of the game.
3. Add sound to the game to make it more fun and exciting.
4. Add multiple rounds (Best of 3) matches and allow players to restart the game without restarting the jar file.
5. Add different maps and more characters to the game.
